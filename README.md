# DRV3-TreasureHunterClone

This project is a clone of the mind mine or treasure hunter monolith mini-game from the Danganronpa V3 game using the Unity3D game engine.

## How to Play
The goal of the game is to clear as many tiles in the game board as possible by removing connected pieces of the same color. Two pieces are considered to be connected if they are adjacent either horizontally or vertically (but not diagonally).

Whenever connected pieces of the same color are removed from the board, the surrounding pieces change in color in the following order:
Red -> Green -> Blue -> Red

The game ends when there are no more valid moves.
